In this exercise, you'll work with a toy data set showing product purchases from an electronics store. 
While the data set is small and simple, it still illustrates many of the challenges you have to address in real-world data wrangling!

The data is in an csv file called refine.csv. Right away, you'll notice that the data set has a few issues:

1. There are four brands: Philips, Akzo, Van Houten and Unilever. However, there are many different spellings and capitalizations of those names!

2. The product code and number are combined in one column, separated by a hyphen. 

**refine_original** is the file on which data wrangling needs to be performed.

**refine_clean** is the file which has been generated after data wrangling
